# Human-Resource-Analytics

This focus of the project is to understand why the best and most experienced employees are leaving the company. The project explores good insights of problems that the Human Resource department deals daily. In many industries retaining their best employees is a question of long term strategy, and can impact the company’s growth or put in financial risk, mainly if the employees leave to work at the competitor.

The project studies various aspects of employees leaving the company, hence helping the companies to know factors responsible and retain their employees.

Data has been very consciously preprocessed and visualized. Each factor has been visualized to perceive its consequence on the employee’s behavior.

At last, various machine learning classifying approaches have been applied to predict whether an employee will leave the company in future or not.
